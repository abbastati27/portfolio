<p><strong>Plant Disease Classification</strong> is a deep learning-based web application designed to identify plant diseases from crop images, helping farmers and agricultural enthusiasts take early action to protect yields.</p>
<br />
<p>The system allows users to upload plant images, then processes them through a trained convolutional neural network (CNN) built with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the presence of diseases. It also provides a confidence score for each prediction to aid in decision-making.</p>
<br /><br />
