<p><strong>Celebrity Classifier</strong> is a machine learning-based web application that identifies celebrities from images using face detection and wavelet-based feature extraction. Built with Flask and OpenCV, it delivers accurate classification results in an easy-to-use interface.</p>
<br />
<p>The system detects faces in uploaded images, extracts distinctive features using wavelet transforms, and classifies the celebrity using a pre-trained machine learning model.</p>
<br /><br />
<h4>Key Features:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>🖼️ <strong>Image Classification:</strong> Predicts celebrity identities by detecting faces and applying wavelet transformations for enhanced feature extraction.</li>
  <li>👀 <strong>Face & Eye Detection:</strong> Uses Haar cascade classifiers to detect facial regions and eyes for precise cropping and analysis.</li>
  <li>🌊 <strong>Wavelet Transform:</strong> Highlights high-frequency image features such as edges, improving model accuracy.</li>
  <li>🔗 <strong>API Integration:</strong> RESTful API built with Flask for classifying base64-encoded images.</li>
  <li>🌍 <strong>CORS Support:</strong> Enables seamless interaction with frontend applications hosted on different domains.</li>
</ul>
